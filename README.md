# AlgoLens

> See your algorithms execute, one step at a time.

AlgoLens is an interactive visual debugger for DSA and software engineering
interview prep. Paste a solution, run it, and step through the **real**
program execution — variables, arrays, pointers, call stack, recursion, and
more — rendered from an actual execution trace, not a scripted animation.

## Status

Phase 11: graphs. Run BFS, DFS, or Connected Components and watch the
real adjacency structure — nodes, directed edges, the current node, and
named collections like `visited`/`queue`/`stack` — render as you step.
Other languages land in later phases. See
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the overall design and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the phased development process.
